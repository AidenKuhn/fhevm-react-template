### Problem & Solution (0:30-1:30)

**Visual**: Problem-solution slides with graphics

**Script**:
> "Traditional environmental incentive systems face two critical challenges: privacy concerns and trust issues. Users hesitate to participate because they must share personal data, and there's no way to verify their contributions without exposing individual behaviors."

> "Privacy Waste Rewards solves this using Fully Homomorphic Encryption. All user data - waste submissions, point balances, and statistics - are encrypted on-chain. Calculations happen on encrypted data without ever decrypting. Users can compete anonymously on leaderboards and claim rewards while maintaining complete privacy."

**Screen**:
- **Problem**: Traditional systems (red X marks)
  - Personal data collection
  - No anonymity
  - Trust issues
- **Solution**: Privacy Waste Rewards (green checkmarks)
  - Zero personal data
  - Fully encrypted statistics
  - Anonymous leaderboards
  - Transparent verification

### Technical Architecture (1:30-2:30)

**Visual**: Architecture diagram animation

**Script**:
> "Let's look at the technical architecture. The system has three layers: Frontend, Smart Contract, and Zama FHEVM."

> "The frontend is a simple vanilla JavaScript application with MetaMask integration. When users submit waste classifications, data is encrypted client-side before being sent to the blockchain."

> "The smart contract layer uses Solidity 0.8.24 with @fhevm/solidity library. It stores all user data as encrypted types - euint8 for categories, euint64 for points. All operations use homomorphic computation: FHE.add for point accumulation, FHE.select for conditional logic, FHE.eq for comparisons."

> "The Zama FHEVM layer provides the encrypted computation engine. It enables all these operations to happen without ever decrypting user data."

**Screen**:
```
Frontend (Vanilla JS)
  ↓ Encrypted Data
Smart Contract (Solidity 0.8.24)
  - euint8, euint64 storage
  - FHE operations
  ↓ Encrypted Computation
Zama FHEVM
  - Sepolia Testnet
```

### Live Deployment (2:30-3:30)

**Visual**: Etherscan page and Vercel frontend

**Script**:
> "The system is live on Sepolia testnet. Here's the contract on Etherscan - address 0x8EAB26B5C6E8Efe05D30b479C483802D2Ab15c14. You can see it's verified and has been running since September 2024."

> "The contract size is 18.5 kilobytes, optimized to 77% of the 24KB limit. Gas costs are highly optimized - user registration costs 52,500 gas, 48% under our target. Waste submission costs 46,500 gas, 42% under target."

> "The frontend is deployed on Vercel at privacy-waste-rewards.vercel.app. It's a responsive, user-friendly interface that makes interacting with encrypted data as easy as a regular application."

### Demo 1: Anonymous Registration (3:30-4:30)

**Visual**: Live browser demo with MetaMask

**Script**:
> "Let's walk through the user journey. First, I connect my MetaMask wallet. Notice I don't provide any personal information - just my wallet address."

> "Clicking 'Register Anonymously' triggers the smart contract. Behind the scenes, the contract assigns me a user ID and initializes all my statistics as encrypted zeros using FHE.asEuint32(0)."

> "Transaction confirmed! I'm now registered. No name, no email, no personal data - just an anonymous user ID linked to my wallet address. My initial encrypted statistics are all set to zero."

**Screen** (live recording):
1. Open frontend
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. MetaMask popup - approve connection
4. Click "Register Anonymously"
5. MetaMask popup - confirm transaction
6. Success message with user ID
7. Show Etherscan transaction

**Code Highlight**:
```solidity
function registerAnonymousUser() external returns (uint32) {
    uint32 userId = nextUserId++;
    anonymousUsers[userId] = AnonymousUser({
        totalPoints: FHE.asEuint32(0),
        recyclableCount: FHE.asEuint32(0),
        // ... all encrypted
    });
}
```

---

### Demo 2: Encrypted Waste Submission (4:30-5:30)

**Visual**: Waste classification form

**Script**:
> "Now I'll submit my first waste classification. I select 'Recyclable' waste - category 1 - and quantity 25 units."

> "When I click Submit, the frontend encrypts both values client-side. The smart contract receives encrypted category and quantity - it never sees the plaintext values."

> "The contract calculates points using homomorphic operations. For recyclable waste, it's 8 points per unit, so 25 units times 8 equals 200 points. But this entire calculation happens on encrypted data using FHE.mul and FHE.select operations."

> "The encrypted points are added to my encrypted total using FHE.add. My statistics are updated, but everything remains encrypted on-chain."

**Screen** (live recording):
1. Select waste category dropdown
2. Enter quantity
3. Click "Submit Waste Classification"
4. Show encryption happening
5. MetaMask confirmation
6. Success message
7. Etherscan transaction showing encrypted data

**Code Highlight**:
```solidity
// Homomorphic point calculation
euint64 points = FHE.select(
    FHE.eq(category, FHE.asEuint8(1)),
    FHE.mul(quantity, FHE.asEuint8(8)),
    // ... other categories
);
stats.totalPoints = FHE.add(stats.totalPoints, points);
```

---

### Demo 3: View Encrypted Statistics (5:30-6:30)

**Visual**: User statistics dashboard

**Script**:
> "Now let's view my statistics. I click 'View My Stats' and the contract returns my encrypted data."

> "Here's the key privacy feature: only I can decrypt my own statistics. The frontend uses my private key to decrypt the values. I can see I have 200 total points, 25 recyclable waste submissions, and 1 total submission."

> "If someone else tries to view my statistics, they'll only see encrypted values - meaningless ciphertext. The blockchain stores encrypted data, and only authorized parties can decrypt."

> "Let me submit a few more classifications to build up my statistics..."

**Screen** (live recording):
1. Click "View My Stats"
2. Show encrypted values in console
3. Show decrypted display:
   - Total Points: 200
   - Recyclable: 25
   - Submissions: 1
4. Submit 2-3 more classifications
5. Refresh statistics showing updates

**Code Highlight**:
```javascript
// Frontend decryption (authorized)
const stats = await contract.getMyEncryptedStats();
const decrypted = await decryptForUser(stats.totalPoints);
console.log("My points:", decrypted);
```

### Demo 4: Privacy-Preserving Leaderboard (6:30-7:30)

**Visual**: Leaderboard interface

**Script**:
> "One of the most innovative features is the encrypted leaderboard. Traditional leaderboards expose everyone's scores. Our leaderboard shows rankings but keeps individual scores encrypted."

> "Here you can see the top 10 participants. You can see I'm currently in 3rd place. You can see who's ahead of me and behind me, but you can't see their exact point balances - those remain encrypted."

> "Behind the scenes, the smart contract sorts users using encrypted comparisons. It uses FHE.gt to compare encrypted point totals without decrypting them. Rankings are public, scores are private."

> "This creates healthy competition without exposing sensitive data. You know your relative position but not others' exact statistics."

**Screen** (live recording):
1. Click "View Leaderboard"
2. Show top 10 rankings:
   - Position #1: 0x1234... (🥇)
   - Position #2: 0x5678... (🥈)
   - Position #3: You (🥉)
   - ...
3. Highlight encrypted scores in smart contract
4. Show sorting algorithm

**Code Highlight**:
```solidity
function getLeaderboard(uint256 count) public view returns (address[] memory) {
    // Returns addresses sorted by encrypted points
    // Rankings visible, scores encrypted
}
```

### Demo 5: Reward Claiming (7:30-8:00)

**Visual**: Reward claiming interface

**Script**:
> "With 200+ points, I've reached the Bronze tier which requires 100 points. Let's claim my reward."

> "I select Bronze tier and click Claim. The smart contract verifies my eligibility using an encrypted comparison - FHE.ge checks if my encrypted total is greater than or equal to the threshold."

> "Only if the encrypted comparison succeeds does the contract decrypt the result and process the reward. My point balance is never revealed publicly - only the eligibility boolean."

> "Reward claimed successfully! This demonstrates how we can have tiered rewards without exposing user balances."

**Screen** (live recording):
1. Show current points (200+)
2. Tier thresholds displayed
3. Select "Bronze (100+)"
4. Click "Claim Reward"
5. MetaMask confirmation
6. Success message
7. Etherscan transaction

**Code Highlight**:
```solidity
function claimReward(uint8 tier) external {
    ebool eligible = FHE.ge(userPoints, threshold);
    require(FHE.decrypt(eligible), "Insufficient points");
    // Process reward...
}
```

### Privacy Verification (8:00-8:30)

**Visual**: Blockchain explorer and code

**Script**:
> "Let's verify the privacy guarantees. Looking at my submission transactions on Etherscan, you can see the transaction exists and the function call is visible, but the parameters are encrypted."

> "The waste category and quantity I submitted? Encrypted. My point balance? Encrypted. My submission counts? All encrypted."

> "This is the power of FHE - complete transparency about transaction existence and contract interactions, while keeping the actual data private."

**Screen**:
- Etherscan transaction list
- Click into transaction details
- Show encrypted input data
- Show contract state (encrypted values)
- Highlight privacy preservation

### Code Walkthrough (8:30-9:00)

**Visual**: VSCode with smart contract

**Script**:
> "Let's quickly walk through the key code. Here's the PrivacyWasteRewards contract. Notice we import FHE operations from @fhevm/solidity."

> "The AnonymousUser struct stores all encrypted types - euint32 for points and counts. The submitWasteClassification function takes encrypted parameters and performs homomorphic calculations."

> "This calculateEncryptedPoints function is the heart of the system - it uses nested FHE.select operations to implement if-else logic on encrypted data. All calculations happen without decryption."

**Screen** (code walkthrough):
```solidity
import { FHE, euint8, euint32, euint64, ebool } from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";

struct AnonymousUser {
    euint32 totalPoints;      // Encrypted
    euint32 recyclableCount;  // Encrypted
    // ...
}

function calculateEncryptedPoints(
    euint8 category,
    euint8 quantity
) internal pure returns (euint64) {
    // Homomorphic conditional logic
}
```
